# Changelog - Card Simulator

## Todos / Bugs / Ideas

- rebuilding the "old" structures
	- generating PDFs
	- making cards directly accessible through direct links (posibly through paremeters)
	- directly selectable categories
	- link to the repository / XML-files with the links
- individual "give me more" text?
- more advanced PDF generator
	- now that PDFs can be generated "on the fly": adjustable size and colors, etc.
	- front page with additional information
- speed improvements, why is it so slow?
- more mobile friendly? how with p5.js?

## Release 0.40 (Work in Progress)

- finally: proper setup with separated repositories 
- p5js can directly access
- Processing is NOT needed anymore
	- thank you for everything, it was a pleasure to work with you!
- no porn anymore
